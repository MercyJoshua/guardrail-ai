# Guardrail AI 🛡️  
**Agentic AI for Practical Cybersecurity Decision Support**

Guardrail AI is a multi-agent cybersecurity assistant built using **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**.  
It helps security administrators detect suspicious activity, analyze threats, recommend actions, and communicate clearly — reducing alert fatigue while keeping humans in control.

##  Problem

Security teams face:
- Overwhelming volumes of security logs
- Increasingly sophisticated AI-powered attacks
- Alert fatigue and slow response times
- Difficulty translating technical findings into clear actions

Traditional tools generate alerts but do not **reason, prioritize, or communicate effectively**.

---

##  Solution

Guardrail AI uses an **agentic architecture** where specialized AI agents collaborate to:

1. Monitor security events  
2. Analyze threats and assess risk  
3. Recommend prioritized response actions  
4. Communicate findings clearly to administrators  

This approach accelerates decision-making **without replacing human judgment**.
